### Research Question and motivations:  
As university students who appreciate the value of a good avocado toast, understanding
the trends of the avocado market directly allows us to enjoy one of our favourite snacks
without breaking the bank. By taking a closer look at certain factors that may influence
avocado prices, we hope to be better able to navigate the market and manage our avocado-
related expenses more effectively.  
To accomplish this, we will examine the following factors Type, Region, Month, Year,
and Average Price, along with the factor total volume sold as our response variable. Given
type, region, month and year, we will build a linear model that can predict the average price of
avocados that would maximize profits. This will allow us to investigate correlations between
the factors that we chose, and allow us to understand trends in the avocado market.
By better understanding this correlation, we hope to make more informed decisions about
when and where to purchase avocados, allowing us to indulge in our favorite snack without
compromising our financial well-being.
